After seeing General Sherman and a smorgasbord of giant sequoias, I asked Steve and Tamryn to pay a visit to the Sentinel tree, because I knew it is a short drive and it's right next to the road. I visited the tree once before with Attila, it was close to the end of the day and we also saw a bear that time. So I ended up joggin to the tree and snap two scenes. This scene is the fors one followed by the last one. I was reading out loud the information on the board on the videos.
